## Signaling an Issue

Before signaling an issue, please check that there isn't already a similar one in the bug tracking system.

The issue may have already been corrected, but the changes have not been deployed yet.

## Small Corrections

Errata and basic clarifications will be accepted if we agree that they improve the content.
You can also open an issue so we can figure out how or if it needs to be addressed.

If you've never done this before, the [flow guide](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) might be useful.

## Large Rewrites

Open an issue for discussion before you start.
These changes tend to be very subjective, often only clarifying things for some small percentage of people and it's rarely worth the time to accept them.
Professional copy editors have already reviewed this content multiple times so while you may have somewhat better taste and grammar than we do it's unlikely that your prose is going to be *so* much better that it's worth changing vast swaths of text.
